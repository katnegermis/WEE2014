The WordPress Loop is a loop in which data is fetched from a database and post data is displayed. The loop can be customized such that data is fetched based on some criterias other than the defaults. There can be multiple loops on a page.

The loop usually is a while loop on `have_posts()` calling `the_post()`, after which point functions such as `the_content()` and `the_title()` will output the content and title of a single post.

The default of `WP_Query` is to order descending.
~~~~~
$args = array('posts_per_page' => 3, 'post_type' => 'event')
$q = WP_Query($args);
while (q->have_posts()): q->the_post();
    <!-- do stuff -->
endwhile;
~~~~~

d)
-------
`query_posts()` is a convenience function on the global variable `$wp_query`, which is an instance of `WP_Query`. The difference between using `query_posts()` and creating a `WP_Query` object 'manually' is that using `query_posts()` you will override/reuse the global object in `$wp_query`, while creating `WP_Query`'es manually will create new objects which do not interfere with each other; If `query_posts()` is used within another `$wp_query` loop, the effect is that the data in the object is discarded/overridden by the new query.

It seems to me to be less error prone to assign new instances of WP_Query to fresh variables, instead of trying to use the convenience functions available on `$wp_query`. This way it's a lot easier to reason about and see which function calls apply to which query.

e)
----
As written in d), `query_posts()` modifies the global variable `$wp_query`, and therefore is not safe to use in some cases. `query_posts()` should only be used for the main loop of a page.
This is not the case for `get_posts()` which doesn't modify global variables, and is always safe to use; `get_posts()` _returns_ a list of posts which the user can assign to a variable by a name of his choice.
